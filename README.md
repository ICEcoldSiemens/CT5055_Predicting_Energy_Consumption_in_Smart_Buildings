# CT5055_Predicting_Energy_Consumption_in_Smart_Buildings_
Predicts future energy consumption based on historical usage data. Used the "Household Electric Power Consumption" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to leverage the temporal dependencies in the data and create a robust predictive model.

# Recurrent Neural Networks for Time-Series Forecasting
Instructions
 1. Data Preprocessing: Normalize values, handle missing data, and create sequences of temporal data suitable for training an RNN model.

 2. Model Architecture: Design an RNN-based architecture (LSTM or GRU). Specify the number of layers, hidden units, and additional components.

 3. Training Process: Train the model and monitor performance using evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE).

 4. Prediction: Implement a mechanism to predict future energy consumption based on historical data.

 5. Hyperparameter Optimization: Experiment with different sequence lengths, learning rates, and batch sizes to optimize model performance.

 6. Evaluation: Compare model performance with a simple moving average baseline. <br></br>

 

# Markov Decision Process (MDP) for Energy Consumption Modeling
 1. State Representation: Define states based on the historical energy usage data and discretization strategies.

 2. Transition Probabilities: Calculate transition probabilities between energy consumption states and create a transition matrix.

 3. Reward Function: Define a reward function to optimize energy consumption based on expected future usage values.

 4. Policy Optimization: Implement Value Iteration or Policy Iteration to find an optimal policy for energy consumption minimization.

 5. Evaluation: Compare the MDP approach with another forecasting method (e.g., RNN). <br></br>
